    2.  **Completeness:** Have all Step-by-Step Instructions (Section 4) been fully executed?
    3.  **Accuracy & Justification:** Are claims supported by cited evidence (Section 7)? Is the analysis sound?
    4.  **Formatting & Structure:** Does the report adhere to the specified Output Format and Structure (Section 5)?

 Remember: **Specificity is key.**

## The DeepResearch Process

### Identify the Knowledge Gap:

The process begins by identifying a specific area where you lack clarity or need actionable information. This could be anything from understanding a market trend or emerging technology to analyzing a competitive landscape.

### Define the Scope and Fill Out The Template:

This is the most critical step. You must clearly define the boundaries of the research to get a meaningful report. This involves filling out the detailed "Ultimate Deep Research Prompt Builder Template." The text highlights two ways to do this:

- Direct Method: Write your core ideas and research goals directly into the topic section of the template.

- Refined Method (Preferred): Use a reasoning-focused LLM (like ChatGPT-4o) to help you brainstorm and refine the scope first. You then take this refined scope and insert it into the template.

### Clarify or Die (Mandatory Clarification)
After providing the prompt, the AI is instructed to ask for clarification if any part of the request is ambiguous, unclear, or contradictory. The user must engage in this clarification loop, answering the AI's questions to resolve ambiguities before the AI begins the actual research.

### Customize for the Task
You tailor the AI's output by defining its Role (e.g., "Senior Industry Analyst," "Technical Consultant") and the desired Output Format. This ensures the report's tone, technical depth, and structure match your specific needs.

### Run It Through DeepResearch
Once the prompt is fully defined, refined, and clarified, you "unleash" it on the AI to execute the deep research and generate the report.

### Iterate, Synthesize, and Repeat
The initial output from the AI is treated as an early draft, not the final product. You should review it, ask for deeper analysis on specific points, and rigorously audit the citations. If sources are poor (e.g., dead links), the process may need to be re-run with stricter source requirements.

### Achieve the Final Output: Actionable Insight
The process is complete when the AI's output has been refined to the point where it perfectly aligns with all the requirements set in the initial prompt (especially the quality checklist in Section 9 of the template). The final result should be a clear, crisp report with data-backed recommendations and actionable insights.

# Pro Tips From Experience

- Treat Scope Like Firewall Rules: I have very strict firewall rules, and so do my DeepResearches. One tiny "extra metric" can easily throw off the entire report.
- Concrete Timeframes: "Past five years (2021-2025)" always beats vague terms like "recent."
- Chain Reports: For complex topics, run multiple prompts per subtopic.
